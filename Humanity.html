              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                Humans are warm-blooded mammals who give birth to live
                offspring, and nourish their offspring with milk. They have five
                fingers, one being an opposable thumb, which a few Covenant
                species do not have. It was a major part in helping humans
                dominate on Earth. Their circulatory system is closed and
                consists of one heart and a network of blood vessels and red
                blood due to the iron-based hemoglobin of humans, as well as two
                lungs which breathe mainly a nitrogen-oxygen-based atmosphere.
                Externally, they have more hair than most Covenant species.
                Their eyes have more pinpointed pupils allowing for good vision,
                and their sense of hearing can detect very low pitch sounds.
                However, their sense of smell is fairly poor. They are
                omnivorous, meaning that they will eat both meats and plants, as
                well as consume high calcium foods, such as the milk of other
                animals, in great quantities. They have a more developed bone
                structure for protecting organs.
              </p>
              <h3 class="h3 mb-075">History</h3>
              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                The species as a whole was finally pushed into major conflict
                when, after several centuries of spreading throughout many star
                systems and inhabiting hundreds of worlds, they discovered the
                violent, genocidal, theocratic Covenant. As the decades-long war
                wore on, the human race gained the controversial reputation as a
                worthy adversary against the Covenant, despite the fact that
                they were technologically, numerically and physically inferior.
                Humans with the help of the SPARTANs, could hold out in ground
                combat and sometimes defeated the Covenant (on the rare
                occasion, without the aid of the SPARTANs), but in space the
                Covenant had virtually undisputed supremacy, thanks to their
                talents for re-purposing Forerunner technology, space tactics
                and not to mention whenever they were defeated on the ground,
                they would glass the planet. Humans have been able to show great
                bravery when facing insurmountable odds. Some of the members of
                the Covenant wonder why the Hierarchs had refused to allow the
                humans to join them, as they had with the crucial contributions
                of the SPARTAN-IIs been able to hold steadfast even when
                outmatched in almost every way. However, despite great courage,
                the future seemed dark for the survival of the human race as the
                Covenant continued to wipe out their colonies, marching ever
                closer to Earth. On October 20, 2552, Earth was found. In the
                ensuing battles over possession of Earth, humanity suffered
                heavy casualties. March 3, 2553, saw the end of the
                Human-Covenant war as a Pyrrhic victory for humanity and their
                new found Sangheili allies - the majority of the Covenant
                Loyalist military having been defeated at Delta Halo by the
                Sangheilian Fleet, and the rest annihilated by the joint
                Elite-UNSC forces at the Ark. This victory came in time to save
                the human homeworld, thanks to the actions of the Arbiter and
                SPARTAN John-117.
