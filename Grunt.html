              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                The Unggoy (Monachus frigus; Latin, "cold monk") are a sapient
                species of squat bipedal xeno-arthropodal vertebroid lifeforms
                in the unified races of the Covenant. They are the fourth
                species to be assimilated into the Covenant and the
                lowest-ranking species in the hierarchy. They suffer frequent
                mistreatment by almost every other race, particularly by the
                kig-yar, and are primarily used as laborers in peacetime and
                cannon fodder in times of war. Their race was one of the last to
                be absorbed into the Covenant and the second Covenant species to
                be encountered by humans. They are referred to as Grunts by
                humans, as they are considered weak in comparison to their
                superiors, they perform the majority of the physical labor
                required by the Covenant, and due their lack of combat skill
                when compared to other Covenant species.

              <h3 class="h3 mb-075">History</h3>
              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                Very little information about the Unggoy prior to the activation
                of the Halo array survives to the modern era, but it is known
                that theirs was a Tier 4 society. However, they never became
                spacefaring due to a number of factors. Their species' rapid
                breeding cycle led to a population crisis on their homeworld of
                Balaho, which was reflected in and compounded by the near
                complete collapse of the planet's biosphere due to global
                industrialization. Balaho's atmosphere and hydrosphere were
                severely damaged by industrial waste. It's speculated that the
                planet was home to thousands of fish and avian species prior to
                industrialization; afterward, eight out of every ten species was
                driven to extinction. Naturally, this led to a shortage of basic
                resources necessary for survival, which in turn began a brief
                but devastating resource war that left the Unggoy all but bereft
                of any means of self-sufficiency. Entire clans were destroyed,
                cities razed and any semblance of government was nonexistent;
                they had fallen into a state of self-preservation and no longer
                possessed the resources to lift themselves back up from the pit
                they had thrown themselves into.
