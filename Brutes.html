              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                The Jiralhanae (Latin, Servus ferox, translated to "Wild
                Slave"), known by humans as Brutes, are the most recent members
                of the Covenant. They are a large, bipedal, giant ape-like
                species from Doisac. The Jiralhanae have been part of the
                Covenant since before the destruction of the UNSC agricultural
                colony on Harvest, and were resented by the Sangheili for their
                monomaniacal behavior.
              </p>
              <h3 class="h3 mb-075">History</h3>
              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                The Jiralhanae were the second Covenant species encountered by
                the humans following the Kig-Yar raid on the freighter This End
                Up. They were also the first Covenant species encountered by the
                Harvest Colonial Militia. The Jiralhanae's plans to seize power
                over the Sangheili began with their alliance with the High
                Prophet of Truth during the Battle of Harvest and continued to
                gain headway until the eventual splitting of the Covenant. They
                eventually took the role of the Prophets' Honor Guards from the
                Sangheili after the Sangheili failed to prevent the
                assassination of the High Prophet of Regret by Spartan John-117.
                Regret's assassination culminated in the Jiralhanae replacing
                the Sangheili as the leaders of the Covenant military. Though
                the Jiralhanae retained their pack and tribal culture, their
                constant internal feuds began to take a back seat as enmity with
                the Sangheili built up, caused by the similarity in roles
                between the two species. Though the Jiralhanae retained the
                majority of their pre-Covenant technology, they also began to
                incorporate aspects of Covenant technology into their own
                designs, such as mounting plasma cannons onto their Prowlers,
                vehicles with a strong Jiralhanae aesthetic but with some
                Covenant technology. The Jiralhanae have little need to learn
                the languages of other species, instead of relying on
                translation devices.
