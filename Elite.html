              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                The Sangheili (Macto cognatus, "I glorify my kin"), known to
                humans as Elites, are a saurian species of strong, proud, and
                intelligent warriors, as well as skilled combat tacticians. The
                Sangheili are named after their home planet, Sanghelios. Due to
                their skill in combat, the Sangheili have formed the military
                backbone of the Covenant for almost the entirety of its
                existence. They had a fierce rivalry with the Jiralhanae, which
                finally boiled over into open hatred during the Great Schism,
                and the conclusion of the Human-Covenant war.
              </p>
              <h3 class="h3 mb-075">History</h3>
              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                The Sangheili homeworld, Sanghelios, had at one point been
                visited by or had been in contact with the mysterious
                Forerunners. They revered the objects these "gods" had left, and
                considered tampering with them a heresy beyond any other. In 938
                BCE they encountered the San'Shyuum (who would later be known as
                "Prophets" by humans). They were a race that also worshipped the
                Forerunners as gods but had utilized Forerunner technology for
                their own needs, believing that the technology had been left
                behind by the gods as gifts for their children. This sparked a
                war between the two races over how to treat the relics. Even
                though the Sangheili were much more physically imposing and
                numerous, they suffered extreme casualties due to the sheer
                power of the Forerunner dreadnought, a surviving Keyship, and by
                876 BCE even the most devout had to admit that their survival
                depended on the reconstitution of their own Forerunner
                technologies. This, of course, led both sides to an agreement
                that ended with the decommissioning of the Forerunner
                dreadnought and a shaky alliance that eventually expanded into
                the Covenant. The San'Shyuum helped assuage the Sangheili by
                informing them of the Great Journey. By seeking out the Holy
                Rings scattered throughout the galaxy and utilizing them, this
                "Journey" would transform believers into godlike beings, while
                providing salvation from their doomed existence of fighting with
                the Flood. The Sangheili became the bodyguards of the physically
                inferior San'Shyuum, who would search the galaxy for the Halos.
                The Writ of Union was drawn up in 852 BCE in order to codify the
                Covenant. Its first canto clearly outlines the nature of the
                Covenant from the perspective of the San'Shyuum.
