              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                Every worm-like creature is an individual eel, about 1.4 meters
                long, lacking its own central nervous system. It is speculated
                that the Lekgolo have microscopic muscular cilia which are used
                to connect to other Lekgolo and that each cilium is capable of
                communicating chemically similar to a synapse, explaining how
                the species can become a collective being in the form of the
                Mgalekgolo.
              </p>
              <h3 class="h3 mb-075">History</h3>
              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                The Lekgolo evolved on their homeworld of Te and fed by
                burrowing through the ground of their planet. They first came
                into contact with the Covenant when the alien collective landed
                in search of Forerunner artifacts. They found only the destroyed
                remains of a Forerunner space station which had once contained
                many relics, but was now bare due to the actions of the worms,
                which had broken down and eaten the devices. The San'Shyuum
                viewed this as heresy, and declared war on the Lekgolo in what
                would later be called the Taming of the Lekgolo. Covenant Fleet
                commanders soon found that indiscriminate destruction would have
                unacceptable consequences, however: since the Lekgolo lived in
                the sacred relics that the Sangheili were trying to preserve,
                simply annihilating the Lekgolo would have resulted in the
                destruction of some or all of those relics. The Arbiter that was
                created during this crisis suggested that they could be tamed
                and put to better uses as part of the Covenant Hierarchy.
