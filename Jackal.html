              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                During their early history, Kig-Yar society was divided into
                clans that sailed across Eayn's seas as pirates, raiding the
                encampments and settlements of rival clans. Eventually, the
                clans united, and the Kig-Yar species worked together in
                developing space-travel technology. Shortly afterward, they
                established colonies on many small asteroids around Chu'ot. Some
                Kig-Yar continued their ancient ways of life and became pirates
                once more, preying upon merchant starships. These groups of
                pirates were the Kig-Yar's only effective response to the
                overwhelming Covenant military juggernaut that arrived in the
                Kig-Yar home system in 1342.
              </p>
              <h3 class="h3 mb-075">History</h3>
              <p class="text-small mb-1">
                The war between the Covenant and Kig-Yar forces culminated in
                sieges of redoubts on the asteroids surrounding their world.
                Eventually, in order to survive, they accepted Letters of
                Marque: commissions from the Ministry of Tranquility to engage
                in the services of the Covenant, though often this was merely
                used as an excuse to continue their plundering lifestyle. The
                Kig-Yar would spend much of their time preying on the ships of
                the Covenant's enemies, such as humanity. Kig-Yar are around the
                same level as the Unggoy in the Covenant hierarchy, although the
                Kig-Yar despise the Unggoy and believe themselves to be
                superior. These tensions reached a boiling point in 2462, when
                some Kig-Yar in High Charity attempted to poison Infusions,
                recreational narcotics the Unggoy enjoyed, which would have left
                the Unggoy sterile, in retaliation for the Unggoy encroaching on
                their habitats and displacing Kig-Yar nests. Although a junior
                staffer in the Ministry of Concert found evidence of this, the
                High Council failed to properly investigate the incident,
                culminating in the Unggoy Rebellion. A Kig-Yar missionary ship,
                Minor Transgression, was the first Covenant vessel to make
                contact with Humans. The ship raided a commercial freighter
                leaving the planet Harvest, and the events that followed would
                later lead to full-scale military action on the part of humanity
                and the Covenant.
